# openFF-curation  
## README.md


The purpose of this repository is to allow users to track changes to the curation
files used in the Open-FF project.  These files are mostly changed manually when
new material is added to the FracFocus source or when new errors are found.

The files in this repository are **copies** of the actual files used to build
data sets in the Open-FF project.  Copies are made so that sorting and filtering
can be made consistent from one commit to the next.  Note that in these files, all
cells are quoted (not just those that require it).  Further, the quoting character
is the dollar sign ('$') because it is one of a very few characters in a simple ASCII
set that do not turn up in the FracFocus data.
